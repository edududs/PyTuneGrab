# PyTuneGrab

Welcome to the PyTuneGrab documentation! PyTuneGrab is a Python tool designed for downloading and converting YouTube audio and video content. It provides a convenient interface for fetching content, converting videos to MP3 audio, and organizing your media library.

## Main Features
**Audio Download**: Download audio from YouTube videos and convert them to the mp3 format.
**Video Download**: Download videos from YouTube.
**Playlist Handling**: Efficiently download and convert playlists.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- FFmpeg
- PyTube
- MoviePy


## How to Use
1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pytube moviepy
```
2. Make sure you have installed FFmpeg.

3. Import the relevant classes from PyTuneGrab in your Python script.

4. Create a instance of the desired downloader class.

The download will be done in a folder called "downloads" in the root folder of the directory, if an output path is not provided

Below, we present basic examples of use:

### Downloading and Converting Audio
```python
from pytunegrab.core import YTDownloader

downloader = YTDownloader()

# Download and convert a single video
video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id"
converted_audio_path = downloader.download_audio(video_url)

print(f"Converted Audio: {video_url} -> {converted_audio_path}")
```

### Downloading and Converting Video
```python

from pytunegrab import YTDownloader

downloader = YTDownloader()

# Download a video
video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id"
downloaded_video_path = downloader.download_video(video_url)

print(f"Downloaded Video: {video_url} -> {downloaded_video_path}")
```
The script will identify whether it is a playlist or not.

All the downloaders follow a similar pattern. You just need to specify the type of content you want to download, whether audio, video, or a playlist.

### Roadmap
We are committed to expanding the functionalities of this library. Planned future enhancements include:

Improved handling of video resolutions.
Support for additional audio formats.
